A basic Lawnchair demo by Tim Kim
=======================================================================
Lawnchair overview from the homepage:
What is lawnchair?
Sorta like a couch except smaller and outside, also, a client side JSON 
document store. Perfect for webkit mobile apps that need a lightweight, 
simple and elegant persistence solution. 

Features:
- micro tiny storage without the nasty SQL: pure and delicious JSON
- clean and simple oo design with one db table per store
- key/value store.. specifying a key is optional
- happily and handily will treat your store as an array of objects
- terse syntax for searching and therefore finding of objects
